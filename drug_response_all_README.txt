Supplementary Table 2		
Raw drug response data used to compute GI50 values used in this study.  
The columns represent the following: 		
# drug_plate_id = unique identifier for the plate of 3 compounds		
# compound = compound tested		
# CAS.Number = CAS identifier for the compound		
# cell_line_name = cell line lineage		
# test.train = indication of whether the cell line was used in the testing or training set		
# dt = doubling time for the cell lines, as determined from the 3-day assay (hours)		
# gi50 = gi50 computed from fitted curve		
# tgi = total growth inhibition computed from fitted curve		
# lc50 = 50% lethal concentration computed from fitted curve		
# a, d, b, g = parameters of fitted Gompertz curve		
# background_od1, background_od2 = background od values (for correction of background luminesence)		
# od0.1, od0.2, od0.3 = triplicate measures for untreated cells		
# od1.1, od1.2, od1.3… od9.1, od9.2, od9.3 = triplicate measures of number of cells alive after treatment with lowest to highest drug concentration		
# T0_background_od1, T0_background_od2 = background od values (for correction of background luminesence)		
# T0_median_od = median od at T0		
# c1 to c9 = drug concentrations tested		
# units = units of drug concentration tested		


Supplementary Table 4
# This table represents the clustering of sensitive (encoded as 1), resistant (encoded as 3), and ambiguous (encoded as 2).  Ambiguous cell lines did not reliably cluster in the sensitive or resistant categories.  
# Clustering of the cell lines was done on a drug-by-drug basis.  Details of the clustering can be found in the supplementary methods.
